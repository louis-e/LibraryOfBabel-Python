# The Library of Babel Algorithm Python Implementation

The algorithm in this repository is an interpretation of the infinite library concept described by Jorge Luis Borges in his book 'The Library of Babel'. This code can be seen as a working model of the mathematical concept.

After reading the book and spending a long time thinking about it, this is my conclusion: The Library of Babel has far-reaching philosophical implications, touching on several key areas of philosophy such as  epistemology and in particular the model and role of our language itself. By presenting a seemingly infinite collection of information and knowledge, the concept raises questions about the limits of our own perception and it forces us to  reconsider the relationship between  language and knowledge itself. As Michael from Vsauce said it: "This thing blurs the line between invention and discovery. Did you really discover or invent that thing, if it's description already existed?"

For a deeper understanding I can recommend 
watching [https://youtu.be/GDrBIKOR01c?feature=shared&t=1024](https://youtu.be/GDrBIKOR01c?feature=shared&t=1024) or trying out the website based version of this interpretation [https://libraryofbabel.info](https://libraryofbabel.info).

## Features

This implementation supports a forward and reverse search. (Page content <=> Hexagon address)

## Usage

To run this Python code, simply import the required libraries and execute the script. Since this is a simplistic implementation, you need to make according changes directly in the code. The example provided in the code demonstrates how to search for a specific text and obtain its hexagon address, as well as how to search for a specific hexagon address and obtain the content of the page at that address.
